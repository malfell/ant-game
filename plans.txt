--------------------LATER GOALS---------------------------------
•Ant could start at the anthill, go out to collect food, and THEN return.
•Enemies! 
    -Shadow of a bird appears, and there's a time limit where ant needs to find
    cover before the bird gets them.
    -Spider on a web? Ant needs to avoid the spider webs. Avoid spider shadows.
    -Beetles or other bugs are walking around and have the red eye vision code
    where ant needs to avoid getting hit with the red cone because that means 
    ant is caught.
    -Fire ants? Enemy ants?
•Ant could have levels inside a house and need to avoid people and ant traps.
•Menu screen? Instruction tab? 
•Ant gifs for walking animation
•Lives 
    -The user could have a row of ants walking together. When an enemy eats an ant,
    or the leading ant falls into dangerous terrain, then the leader dies, and the
    next ant must lead. So the ants are like "lives."
•Two ant or ant groups at once?
    -Could allow for a second player to use the same keyboard or let the initial
    -have an extra challenge. One ant group is controlled with WASD and the other
    -ant group is controlled with the arrow keys.
