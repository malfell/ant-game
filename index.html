        <h2>Instructions and Controls</h2>
        <p>
            You play as an unfortunate ant who cannot return home until you 
            collect enough food even though there are spiders swarming the 
            area for some reason unknown to you. Alas, your colony is not
            willing to assist you or wait until the spiders leave. 
        </p>
        <p id="smaller">Perhaps they are trying to get rid of you.</p>

        <p>
        If you collect enough food, your ant colony will accept you again (how nice of them!)
        Navigate the map to collect food without getting grabbed by any spiders.
        </p>
        <p>Use the arrowkeys to move. </p>
        <p>Touch food with the ant player to collect it.</p>
        <p>When all food is collected, your ant colony will accept you again.  </p>
        <p>Touch the anthill with the ant player to return home and win. </p>
        <p>If you're hit by a spider, you die (and lose).</p>

    <!-- KNOWN ISSUES -->
    <info id="issues" style="display:none">
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If player presses a new arrow key while still 
                holding down the last arrow key, the ant will 
                freeze for a bit before being able to move.</li>
            <li>Food can currently spawn on the ant hill. 
                Shouldn't do that. </li>
            <li>Canvas size slightly changes when you go between 
                game, start, and instructions. I'm confused on that 
                one because when I made everything the same size, 
                it was off. So I ended up changing sizes 
                individually to make them closer. </li>
            <li>Game continues to run after Game Over. 
                If you click on play again or return to main menu, 
                game will continue from where you left off. 
                I took out out the play again button until I solve this. 
                The return to main menu button will reload the whole page. 
                Not the solution I wanted, but that's what I have for now. </li>
            <li>There is an issue getting the game to restart properly. 
                At the moment, I removed the "Play Again" button, and made the 
                "Return to Menu" button reload the page. Not convenient but a 
                slight temporarily solution.</li>
            <li>There are no spiders or enemies. Just blocks. 
                I haven't had time to make spider sprites. </li>
            <li>The ant sprite used to be animated, but there was an 
                issue when changing the code. I need to go back and rework this.</li>
            <li>Game background could use work. I'd rather not have the single color background.</li>
        </ul>
